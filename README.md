# Feve

Elegant & simple & convenient React + Redux + React Router + Babel + Webpack + BrowserSync boilerplate.

**Feve is currently under development (but it's usable, after all it's a boilerplate), if you have any suggestion, feel free to create a issue!**


# Why Feve

Yes, there're a ton of boilerplates about React project (like [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit)), why another one?

Well, there are 3 main reasons:

1. Overdoing: too much libraries and concepts, some of them are not been used by mainstream companies.

2. Inelegant: this is completely subjective.

3. Inexpedient: some pains should be cured.

If you do felt these, just give `Feve` a try!


# Quick Start

## Install

First, clone `Feve` into your machine:

```
git clone -o feve -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/aaronjan/feve.git MyApp
```

Then go to the project directory, install dependencies:

```
$ cd MyApp
$ npm install
```

Just like that, you just finished installation.

Currently Feve contains a `TODO` example (modified from [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos)) for feature demostration, it will be removed from `master branch` at future.


## Development

By running this:

```
npm start
```

`Feve` will start a development server and run your code with live-reload.


## Production Build

By running this:

```
npm run build
```

`Feve` will compile your source code into production code, when compiling
finished, you can find them in the `build/` folder.
